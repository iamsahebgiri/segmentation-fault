cd trpc-prisma-starter
yarn
yarn dx
```

### Commands

```bash
yarn build      # runs `prisma generate` + `prisma migrate` + `next build`
yarn db-nuke    # resets local db
yarn dev        # starts next.js
yarn dx         # starts postgres db + runs migrations + seeds + starts next.js
yarn test-dev   # runs e2e tests on dev
yarn test-start # runs e2e tests on `next start` - build required before
yarn test:unit  # runs normal jest unit tests
yarn test:e2e   # runs e2e tests
```

## Deployment

### Using [Render](https://render.com/)

The project contains a [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml) [_"Blueprint"_](https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec) which makes the project easily deployable on [Render](https://render.com/).

Go to [dashboard.render.com/blueprints](https://dashboard.render.com/blueprints) and connect to this Blueprint and see how the app and database automatically gets deployed.
